title: "Is Alta available in my region?"
description: "Alta is available only in select countries and regions. Availability can change over time due to regulatory requirements, third-party provider restrictions, and product rollout plans."

At this time, **Alta is not available in the United States**.

## Why availability varies

Access to Alta can be restricted for a few reasons:

- **Geo-blocking:** We may block access from certain locations based on regulatory requirements or other considerations.
- **Third-party providers:** Some features rely on third-party services (for market data, transactions, or other integrations). Those providers may also restrict access in certain countries.
- **Rollout:** Some countries may be enabled before others as we expand.

## Locked vs Unlocked

In the Help Center (and sometimes in the app), you may see features labeled as **Unlocked** or **Locked**.

- **Unlocked:** The feature is currently available for your region.
- **Locked:** The feature is not currently available for your region, or it has not been enabled yet.

## Important rules

- **Do not use a VPN** or any method to try to bypass location restrictions. Attempts to circumvent geo-blocking may result in restricted access.
- Even in supported regions, **some services may be unavailable** if a third-party provider is geo-blocked where you are located.

## If you are traveling

If you travel to a different country, your access may change temporarily. Some features may become unavailable depending on your current location and third-party provider availability.
