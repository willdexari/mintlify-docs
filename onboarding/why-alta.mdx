We are creating a way for anyone to express their view on the world’s markets in seconds. Our mission is to solve the gap between global market activity and individual access.

People see the world moving around them and want ways to participate when the moment happens. They do not want to be restricted by traditional market hours. Alta changes that by providing an always-open venue for the markets that matter.

### We started with 24/7 access

Our foundation is built on the idea that your schedule should dictate when you interact with markets, not the other way around. Alta exists to provide access that fits your real life, whether that is before work, late at night, or on the weekend.

### And expanded to a breadth of global assets

Growth and momentum happen everywhere, from household names to global benchmarks. Alta provides one unified place to predict on:

- **Stocks**: Individual global companies.
- **Indexes**: Major market benchmarks.
- **Private**: Markets for companies before they go public.
- **Metals and Energy**: Real-world assets like gold and oil.
- **Crypto**: Digital asset categories.

### Power and progress for everyone

Access alone is not enough; we believe the experience should be simple and rewarding.

- **Plain Language**: We use literal terms like Predict, Boost, and Cash out so you stay in control.
- **Boost**: You can amplify your results by up to 50x when your conviction is high.
- **The Climb**: Alta is built like a climb where every action earns you XP and moves you forward.
